										<p style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:16px">Historically, both natural and man-made fires have burned their way across North American prairies, providing a disturbance regime that grassland systems are adapted to. With human activity fragmenting these prairies at an accelerated rate since the 1950s, the few prairies that do remain are often fire suppressed, and woody plant species with larger seeds may have a competitive advantage under contemporary conditions. This study seeks to quantify the mechanisms underpinning biodiversity loss from invading woody plants in order to better understand prairie alteration and disappearance. To do so, we investigated the effects of functional seed traits, fire history, and prairie extent. Among seed traits, we found that seed coat thickness has remained relatively constant over the past 60 years and differing fire regimes, suggesting it does not play a major role in plant propagation. Larger and rounder seeds do appear to be influential though, steadily increasing in prevalence with this recent fire exclusion. Prairie extent was found to not be a major contributor to its degree of woodiness, with a patch’s fire history being the ultimate predictor. This work quantifies the significant increase in woody vegetation in Wisconsin’s prairies over the last 60 years (both in burned and unburned remnants), demonstrating the effects of landscape conversion on our natural ecosystems. Finally, this study illustrates the importance of consistent prescribed burning and vigilant monitoring of large, round woody seeds, contributing valuable information on best practices in prairie management.</p>

										<p style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:16px">Cryptotephra, or microtephra, are microscopic deposits of ash resulting from volcanic eruptions. Once found, they can be traced back to a volcano with a known eruption date based on the mineral or geochemical composition of the glass shards that make up the ash. After detection and correlation back to that specific volcano and eruption, this research allows for the verification, correction, and improvement of age models developed by radiometric dating. This relatively new tool is a versatile and cost effective way to improve individual site chronologies due to each layer's unique signature and well-constrained age, while also allowing for correlation to other sites. The primary result of this research was an improved age model for a paleoecological record of past vegetation and climate from Spicer Lake in Indiana, USA. If confirmed, the presence of known cryptotephras in the record allows for more precise dating of past environmental change, giving us a better idea of what to expect in the future.</p>
