The Celtic people were an ethnolinguistic group of tribal societies in Iron Age and Medieval Europe who spoke a common language, Proto-Celtic. The modern Celtic languages are descended from this common language and are mostly spoken in Ireland (Irish), Scotland (Scottish Gaelic), Wales (Welsh), Cornwall (Cornish), Brittany (Breton), and the Isle of Man (Manx). While the Republic of Ireland comes close, none of these languages belong to a completely autonomous state, and thus the languages represent a sense of ethnic nationalism. The purpose of this map is to illustrate how times have changed since the Middle Ages when presumably everyone in these regions spoke their respective Celtic language, to the present where several of these languages require revival programs in order to stay alive.
